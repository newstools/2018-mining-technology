BACKGROUND
Company: GR Engineering/Integra Mining Ltd
Location: Kalgoorlie, WA
Flow rate: 34,600Am³/h
Temperature: 25°C
Industry: Mining – Gold PROBLEM
As part of its new Randall’s Gold Project, located around 60km south-east of Kalgoorlie, Integra Mining installed a large crushing and screening plant. This part of the process produces by far the largest amount of dust which if left untreated would cause a major environmental problem. SOLUTION
To address this issue, an integrated dust extraction system was designed to capture the dust and return it to the process. This was achieved by the installation of a Luhr DF Fabric Filter. The unique feature of this design is its flat horizontal filter bag arrangement, which allows extremely quick and safe inspection of the clean air chamber and bags.
This design eliminates the need to use tools or lifting gear to access the filter bags. Bag changing can be conducted from the generous adjacent access platform and does not require maintenance personnel to enter the filter. As with most Luhr designs, the filters used on this project are based on a modular concept. This allows the filters to be fully assembled with filter bags, pulse cleaning system and electrical controls. The complete unit can then factory tested prior to shipment which not only ensures the filter is fully functional on arrival at site, it also greatly reduces site installation errors, time and labour. RESULT
The unit was supplied on schedule and from information received from site is achieving excellent dust control.
