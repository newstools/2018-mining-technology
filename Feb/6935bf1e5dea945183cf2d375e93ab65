EXAIR’s new VariBlast® Compact Safety Air Guns are a small and lightweight cast aluminium air gun capable of handling tough jobs. Due to the engineered variable flow trigger, they are able to produce light, medium or heavy force upon a target simply by pulling the trigger. Available through Compressed Air Australia, this comfortable and ergonomic air gun has two ¼in air inlets and a storage hanger for convenience. Air consumption of the VariBlast Compact air gun is only 2.5 – 17.5 SCFM (71 – 495 SLPM), depending on the nozzle installed, which is among EXAIR’s most efficient air guns. It is capable of producing up to 454g of force, making it a great choice for light to medium duty applications. These CE compliant Safety Air Guns can use EXAIR’s extensions up to 72in-long for extended reach and can be purchased with a chip shield. This product line of VariBlast Compact Safety Air Guns utilise EXAIR’s 1/8in engineered air nozzles, which reduce compressed air use and meet OSHA requirements for dead-end pressure and noise exposure. All of EXAIR’s Safety Air Gun product lines use engineered air nozzles designed to maximise safety and minimise air consumption. The Heavy-Duty and Soft Grip Safety Air Guns provide higher force for tougher applications.  All are available with extension pipes and Chip Shields.
