At Nautitech, we recognise the importance of compliance with the highest international standards and have been certified to ISO 9001 for more than ten years. As a company that manages every facet of the product lifecycle, from design to development, testing, as well as training and field support, we feel that it’s important to continuously assess and improve our systems. We are pleased to report that after a recent review by BSI, we have successfully transitioned to ISO 9001: 2015 Quality Management Systems – one of a very small number of companies to do so. We are also proud to be an IECEX registered workshop and NATA accredited. BSI Australia general sales and marketing manager Paul Schofield said: “Through the transition assessment Nautitech demonstrated strong commitment to the quality management system and its processes. In line with ISO 9001: 2015, top management is committed to integrate management system processes into business as usual practices, which has resulted in improvements across all of its business functions.” Our customers remain our highest priority and as a manufacturer of safety equipment for potentially dangerous environments, you can be confident that we manage and operate our business with the care and attention that the industry requires.
