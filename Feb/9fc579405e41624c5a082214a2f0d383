 Salter Cyclones was asked to support a client concerned about attrition of solids. A sample of fines gravity feed slurry was tested in a closed circuit by pumping continuously to a 10in Hydrocyclone to quantify the generation of fines. This resulted in the supply of an 11-way radial fitted with Salter Cyclone high-performance SC1030, 10in Hydrocyclones. The feed is abrasive so ceramic spigots will be provided. On another part of the site, a ten-way 5in Hybrid Hydrocyclone Mushroom Assembly has been supplied to thicken a Hydrosizer overflow. The underflow solids content was adjusted to provide optimum operability and separation performance. There is no need for operator intervention making this an economic solution without compromising efficiency.
