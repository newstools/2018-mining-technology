 We are all aware of the great impact that green economy has on the development of the 21st century we are living in. Recycling and giving new life to exhausted materials is the challenge to create a sustainable World economy. In the recycling process, screening is often playing an important role and flip flow machines are more and more used to this scope. One of the major players in UK for the recovery of plastics from waste vehicles and electronic goods called us in the challenge in 2011, because their flip flow screen was not giving the expected performance: the OEM screen panels were blinding because of the material containing high moisture powder and plastic fibers together with electrical wires and plastic scraps. Our boomerang and peanut-shaped apertures have been offering the solution to the problem since 2011 up to now with great satisfaction of us and of the client.
