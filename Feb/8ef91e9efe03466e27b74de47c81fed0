One of the most significant and effective areas of improvement on a mine site is the optimal loading of trucks to maximise circuit output. Without real-time feedback, under-loading trucks is very common due to concern about exceeding the 20% overload capacity and causing the truck to lockdown.  A secondary cause of underloading is due to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) being tied to truck counts. This can result in excavator operators prioritising churning through truck loading and sending a truck off before fully loaded To monitor and improve circuit operations, iVolve’s Mine4D Production was installed across a fleet of 23 trucks and three excavators on a coal mine in the Bowen Basin, Queensland. Mine4D Production provides a real-time snapshot across the entire site production fleet with user-friendly graphic visualisation tools, aiding dispatch personnel and shift managers in timely decision making. Real time feedback on in-cab screens also provides operators with the information they need to optimally load trucks to target every time. Post-installation, production increased by 9.1% over ten shifts results in the same number of tonnes moved in ten shifts as is currently done in 11 shifts, a saving of one shift per week. Saving one shift per week across 23 trucks can result in a saving of $96,600 per week ($4,200/truck * 23 trucks) or $5m per year. NOTE: This does not include savings associated with the remainder of the fleet (non-trucks) operating for one less shift per week.
