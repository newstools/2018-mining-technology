Chesterton’s latest innovation in sealing technology, the 170L Slurry Cartridge Single Seal is engineered to operate reliably in severe slurry environments without external seal flushes in the majority of applications. The seal can help reduce water expenses especially where clean water is scarce or costly to produce. Designed to Fit The 170L is designed to fit Warman® AH® series pumps without pump modification. This eliminates the need to dimensionally check each pump to determine seal form and fit, as well as the requirement to modify the pump to fit a seal design. Designed to Extend Reliability and Seal Life The 170L Slurry Cartridge Single Seal uses a single clamping screw which prevents equipment shaft damage and simplifies seal removal in sticky or viscous fluids, or where solids have a tendency to clog up standard set screw designs. The seal incorporates large clearances and rugged components that resist the effects of heavy slurry environments.
