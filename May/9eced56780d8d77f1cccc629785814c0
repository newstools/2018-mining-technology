 We are looking forward to taking part at AISTech 2018 in Philadelphia, PA, US, from 7 to 10 May. On the show, we will have the HIDROD descaling rotor on display for the first time. We will be happy to further explain the advantages of the Hauhinco rotor descaling technology and, of course, to discuss your water hydraulic press drive and press control questions and requirements at the show. You can find us at booth 3163.
