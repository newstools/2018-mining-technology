Vehicle interactions are extremely disruptive for a mine site, putting the entire production process out of kilter and causing detrimental follow-on effects. One single incident can result in a complete standstill of operations, causing thousands of dollars in lost production. Identifying the speed vehicles were travelling at before a crash is essential for quick and accurate investigation. Problem Without real-time feedback capabilities, it is impossible to establish the exact speed a vehicle was travelling before an incident occurred. This causes problems surrounding warranty claims and the inability to confirm what component, whether that be operator, vehicle or other, caused the incident. Solution Being able to identify the speed vehicles were travelling before an incident allows management to establish what vehicle was at fault and pinpoint the exact cause of the accident. In addition, the play back capability also allows for a strong defence against claims of machine abuse for warranty pushback. iControl is the iVolve map-based visualisation tool displaying your fleetsâ€™ real-time data for a complete overview of the state of the fleet and assets.
