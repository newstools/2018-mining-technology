Durapipe PLX is an above and below ground product range created to fulfil the application needs of various fuel applications. Consisting of both, a single wall and a secondary pipe and fittings range, PLX is specifically designed for the safe transfer of all fuel-based liquids. Strong and robust; polyethyleneâ€™s toughness, together with the innovative inner bore layer, ensures no harmful emissions can escape into the environment. The internal nylon layer also provides a smooth bore surface providing maximum fuel flow rates up to 10bar. The combination of the layers alone (not including the additional support of the secondary containment systems) improves the quality and resistance of our PLX pipe. With no harmful emissions escaping into the environment, health and safety is number one priority for us and quick and easy installation, in comparison to other mainstream materials, ensures our health and safety focus. Durapipe PLX has a 30-year design life making it longer lasting than traditional pipework materials. PLX is an electrofusion system providing a fast and easy to use, convenient way, of installation. All fittings are tested and only after qualification of this rigorous process will PLX fittings be released for sale. Provided with a barcode, fusion times and cooling times, all fittings are 39.5V and easily installed with a standard electrofusion machine.
