EXAIR’s new 1/8 NPT small External Mix spray nozzles atomise fluids up to 94.6 litres (25 gallons) an hour. External Mix nozzles are great where a high volume of liquid is needed. They can be used on liquids with a viscosity up to 800 centipoise. Small external mix nozzles are available in a narrow angle flat fan pattern and are the best choice when a thicker liquid needs heavy application over a narrow band. They combine liquid and compressed air to create a coating of liquid that can be easily adjusted to meet the needs of your application. With EXAIR’s 1/8 NPT small External Mix Atomizing Nozzles, you can coat, cool, treat and paint a variety of products. Used with water or coolant, Atomizing Nozzles are an efficient way to evenly cool hot items in your automated process. Since they are external mix, airflow and liquid flow can be controlled independently which provides the most precise liquid flow. The stainless-steel construction of these Atomizing Nozzles adds to their durability and corrosion-resistance. EXAIR Atomizing Nozzles are also available in 1/4 and 1/2 NPT in a variety of flow patterns and liquid rates to meet your needs. Internal mix and siphon fed Atomizing Nozzles are offered too, as well as patented no-drip versions of every Atomizing Nozzle. Available from Compressed Air Australia, all models are adjustable, CE compliant and come with our five-year built to last warranty.
