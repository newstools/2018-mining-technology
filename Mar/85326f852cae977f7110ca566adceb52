EXAIRâ€™s new Sanitary Flange Line Vac air-operated conveyors are the best way to convey materials through systems which require frequent or mandatory cleaning. The ISO 2852 compatible sanitary flanges limit areas where bacteria can grow and help prevent contamination. Made from type 316 stainless-steel to provide maximum hygiene and corrosion-resistance, these Line Vacs are available in 1.5in, 2in, 2.5in and 3in (38mm, 51mm, 64mm and 76mm) flange sizes. Flanged Line Vacs convert flanged piping systems into a powerful conveyor for product, parts, scrap, trim and other bulk materials. Their larger size makes them perfect for conveying bigger parts and large volumes of material over long distances. Sanitary Flange Line Vac Conveyors eject a small amount of compressed air to produce a vacuum on one end with high output flows on the other. Response is instantaneous and regulating the compressed air pressure provides infinite control of the conveying rate. Applications include material conveying, part transfer, fibre tensioning, scrap trim removal and filling operations. Available from Compressed Air Australia, all EXAIR Line Vacs are CE compliant, meet OSHA pressure requirements, and are ready to ship from stock. Additional families of Line Vac are available to fit hose, tube or threaded pipe. Many smaller sizes are available down to 3/8in hose or 3/8 NPT threads and large hose or pipe sizes up to 5in (127mm). Many other materials are available including aluminium, type 303 and type 316 stainless-steel. Heavy-Duty Line Vacs are available in hardened alloy for abrasion-resistance and maximum conveying power.
