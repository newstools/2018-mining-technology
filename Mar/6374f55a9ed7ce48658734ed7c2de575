Maccaferri ‘Paramesh’ MSE wall System is a cross product consisting of Terramesh® units with ParaLink® geosynthetic soil reinforcement grids. Maccaferri was involved by the project executives due to the very critical technical requirements imposed for the erection of a 12.5m-high, 120m-long tip wall at the Grootegeluk mine.  Maccaferri ‘Paramesh’ prevailed over traditional reinforced concrete solutions for its cost-effectiveness and flexibility. Critical design criteria The design phase of the Grootegeluk Medupi Expansion Project required a more strategic solution for a 12.5m-high tip wall to accommodate 130t CAT 777 tipper trucks carrying coal deposits, which imposed a very high design criteria of 250kPa pressure on the wall. In addition, the soils utilised in the construction of the wall were overburden coal residue, requiring corrosion resistance to those harsh soils and flexibility to withstand differential settlement. Reinforced soil prevails over reinforced concrete The initial design was carried out by considering a traditional cantilever reinforced concrete wall. Given the resulting costs, Maccaferri was contacted to submit a different solution and proposed a reinforced soil structure respecting all design criteria and offering a significant construction cost reduction. Final facts Thanks to Maccaferri’s in-house MacSTARS W software programme for slope stability, a MSE wall was conceived offering the following advantages: In conclusion, Maccaferri reinforced soil solution can offer advantages for the mining industry such as overall cost reduction, reliability and improved flexibility.
