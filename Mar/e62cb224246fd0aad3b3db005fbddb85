 When we presented GET flexy to our clientele, we did expect a lively interest in the product but we had no idea so many users were in an actual emergency in terms of lack of performance with their screens. This made us understand that the market is ready for a new improvement in terms of classification quality and performance. This improvement is now possible through the coupled action of a flip flow screening machine with GET flexy as screening media. In fact, EUROGOMMA has concluded an agreement with Italian company Bonera Ecologia being the manufacturer of flip flow screens for the last 30 years with significant applications in material recycling in Italy and other European countries. With Bonera Ecologia having the knowledge and guaranteeing the technical and production control supervision, EUROGOMMA can offer a 360Â° technology for every necessity and application.
