 Atlas Copco, a leading provider of sustainable productivity solutions, has won a significant order from Chilean mining company Sociedad Punta del Cobre SA. The equipment, which will increase productivity and reduce production costs, will be delivered by Epiroc. Punta del Cobre, commonly known as Pucobre, ordered Epiroc loading and hauling machines to be used in three copper mines in the Atacama region in northern Chile. The order totals MUSD 26 (MSEK 205) and was received in the first quarter 2018. The order was placed with Epiroc, the wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Copco that will be separated and listed on the stock exchange in mid-2018 provided approval by Atlas Copco shareholders. “We are proud to play a key role as Pucobre takes its mining productivity to a higher level,” said Helena Hedblom, president of Atlas Copco’s Mining and Rock Excavation Technique business area. “We are focused on ensuring customers get more productivity, energy savings and operator safety.” Pucobre has previously purchased drill rigs from Atlas Copco. The new equipment includes the Minetruck MT65 and the Scooptram ST18 underground loader. The top-performance machines will be delivered over the next two years and will be equipped with the Epiroc telematics system Certiq, allowing automated and intelligent monitoring of productivity and machine performance.
The Minetruck MT65 is part of the order.
