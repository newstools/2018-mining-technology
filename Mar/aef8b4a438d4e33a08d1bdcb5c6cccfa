 Derisk Geomining Consultants celebrated its first anniversary earlier this month.  In the 12 months since commencement, Derisk has secured 19 engagements with a further 6 proposals under negotiation. To date, our projects have been in Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Europe, with a focus on gold, copper, coal, nickel, base metals, tin and phosphate.  Our work has included exploration reviews and valuations, drill planning and monitoring, database support, resource estimates, scoping studies, resource/reserve reconciliation, project technical reviews, preparation of independent reports and delivery of professional development workshops. We have stayed true to our core values of ‘providing Tier One advice and services without the Tier One price tag’ by operating a digital office-less structure with a small core team of staff and an extensive network of trusted and experienced associates located globally. We are indebted to everyone who has contributed to our progress over the past 12 months, particularly our employees, associates and clients, and we look forward to the coming year with anticipation and excitement.
