We are pleased to announce the re-launch of our SatVUE.com.au website. We’ve improved the overall structure of the site; breaking it down into ‘Products’, ‘Sensors & Integrations’, and Applications’. With even more content to be added soon, feel free to bookmark the site and drop by on a regular basis! Existing SatVUE user? You will still be able to login via the web portal remotely to view your data, configure your sensors, check battery or signal strength, be alerted to any problems, and more! What is SatVUE? SatVUE is a low-cost smart remote monitoring solution utilising satellite communications to reliably collect, store and report data that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via an internet-enabled computer or mobile device. By removing the need for staff to physically visit sites and conduct manual measurements/data retrieval where monitoring is being conducted, SatVUE could, in turn, save thousands of dollars in travel and staff resource expenses every year. The SatVUE system utilises a simple plug & play approach for simple field installations. By utilising minimal hardware, in contrast with alternative solutions on the market, this cost-effective, robust system is a reliable choice for the end user.
