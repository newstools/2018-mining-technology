An eagle eye recently spotted Nautitech IS Lights and a Nautitech Methane System front and centre on an underground coal loader from BMA Broadmeadows. The loader was given the important task of transporting the Queen’s Baton during a leg of its journey through Isaac, QLD, to this year’s Commonwealth Games. As an Australian company that designs and manufactures its products locally, we are proud to have been a small part of the year-long journey of the Queen’s message from Buckingham Palace to the opening ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. We applaud the hard work and commitment of our Australian athletes and will be cheering them on as they go for gold on the Gold Coast!
