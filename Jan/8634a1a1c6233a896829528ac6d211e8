Our client stocks thousands of tonnes of RAP and had a major problem with the product holding water, which meant that to use it not only meant wasting money on drying the product before use but also drastically slowing down the production process. They say that time cost money – in this case, a definite YES IT DOES! Also letting your customers down due to product not being ready on time could mean they go elsewhere. Why not go for a concrete block wall option and a series of Zappshelters to not only cut your running costs, but also to retain your customers and at the same time become renowned for one of the best ‘on-time suppliers’ in the market. It’s true – ZAPPSHELTER does help with a return on investment.
