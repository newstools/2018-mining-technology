Stepping up to the challenge of providing efficient and reliable access at greater heights, Equiptec’s VRS Giraffe 3409 has hit the runway. Seeking a versatile multiuse unit for maintenance requirements, Air New Zealand sought to customise the multiunit work platform to meet stringent aviation and safety standards and fulfil a measure of tasks. Weather and landing conditions can be unpredictable on the tarmac, so enlisting a work platform that ensures safety at heights – maintenance on, up and around aeroplanes – is essential for peace-of-mind.  Encompassing a minimal floor footprint platform that staff can tread with ease, means maintenance can be carried out resourcefully. With staff and airline safety at the fore, the VRS Giraffe 3409 new ‘Go Guard’ flexible, conforming hand rails aid travel from bottom to top, providing superior support for all ages, heights and hand requirements. The pivoting front deck of the VRS Giraffe 3409 enables workers to manoeuvre the platform to exact placement – without compromising safety – and the Giraffe’s 2.2m cantilevering abilities allows it to reach over obstacles seamlessly.  Nosing into different areas of a plane is now straightforward and savvy, ensuring work is carried out on time, every time. Whatever your specific industry needs and workplace requirements, Equiptec’s VRS Giraffe can be retrofitted and custom-designed to fit your fit.  For a multiunit work platform that encompasses an array of features – all-wheel steering, hinged safety bar with grasper latch, lockable gates, forklift pockets and much more – speak to Equiptec.
