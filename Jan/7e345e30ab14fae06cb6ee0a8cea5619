 BACKGROUND
Company: Fortescue Metals
Location: Cloudbreak Mine, WA
Flow rate: 2 units, 79,200Am³/h and 358,000Am³/h
Temperature: 25°C
Industry: Mining – Iron Ore PROBLEM
FMG’s aggressive throughput expansion required a dust collection solution which could be delivered and installed within a tight timeline to meet start-up and ramp-up production requirements at Cloudbreak toward the steady-state volume of 45 Million Tonnes to supply the Chinese market for 20 years. SOLUTION
Luehr Filter was selected to supply ‘SDF’ filters, which feature ‘online’ pulse cleaning and a vertical bag orientation for the crushing and screening facility at FMG Cloudbreak. The fabric used in the filters include a hydrophobic coating to handle the Pilbara’s high humidity during the wet season. As with most Luehr designs, the filters supplied for these projects are based on a modular concept. This design allows the filters to be fully assembled and tested in the factory prior to shipping. The full assembly and testing of the filter packages was a key decision point in the selection of Luehr as the supplier because speed of delivery, installation and start-up was a key consideration of FMG. RESULT
The units were delivered to schedule, installed quickly and are achieving excellent dust control, exceeding the emission requirements. Additionally, the systems have high uptime, which has provided worry-free operation and maintenance over the installed life-to-date.
