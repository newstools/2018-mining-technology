 EXAIR’s new Gen4 Super Ion Air Knife eliminates static electricity 34% better at low inlet pressures, saving compressed air and money. Production speeds, product quality and surface cleanliness can improve dramatically. It eliminates static on plastics, webs, sheet stock and other product surfaces where tearing, jamming or hazardous shocks are a problem. Gen4 products have undergone independent laboratory tests to certify they meet the rigorous safety, health and environmental standards of the US, EU and Canada that are required to attain the CE and UL marks. They are also RoHS compliant. New design features include a metal armoured high-voltage cable to protect against abrasion and cuts, integrated ground connection and electromagnetic shielding. The Gen4 Super Ion Air Knife incorporates EXAIR’s Super Air Knife that minimizes compressed air use by inducing surrounding airflow at a ratio of 40:1. The unique amplified airflow carries the ions to the target, making it possible to eliminate static charges in less than a half-second. Air volume and velocity are infinitely controllable from a ‘breeze’ to a ‘blast; to gently wipe or forcefully blow away debris. EXAIR’s Gen4 Super Ion Air Knife product line is available in 7.62cm (3in) to 2.74m (108in) long. The electrical ion source is shockless and there is no radioactive element. A new selectable voltage power supply has been designed to operate Gen4 products.. Applications include surface cleaning, neutralizing plastics, bag opening, printing machinery, packaging operations and elimination of painful static electricity shocks. The entire Gen4 static elimination product line is available through Compressed Air Australia.
