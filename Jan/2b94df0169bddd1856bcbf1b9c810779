 BACKGROUND
Company: Abosso Gold/Savannah Nickel
Location: Damang Gold Mine, Ghana Africa
Flow rate: 32,000Am³/h
Temperature: 35°C
Industry: Mining – Gold PROBLEM
As part of their expansion Abosso Gold installed a Primary Crusher at their Damang Gold Mine in South West Ghana. The dust generated during the crushing process was considerable and therefore required control. SOLUTION
Luehr received the order for the supply of a dust collection system for the application. Due to a plentiful supply of process water and its relatively lower capital cost, a wet scrubber was chosen for this application. The unit selected was a Trema ZK 180 cyclonic scrubber. The ZK design is suitable for the high dust loads that are generated during crushing and efficiencies as high as 99% can be achieved on this type of application. The system is designed with a once-through water system. The collected slurry is pumped to the mines existing water treatment plant where it is clarified before being returned to the scrubber. RESULT
The scrubber was shipped as a fully assembled unit from our Melbourne manufacturing facility on a flat rack and arrived on-site ready for installation. Feedback was that it was successfully commissioned and is meeting the required emission standards.
