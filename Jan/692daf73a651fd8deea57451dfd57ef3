For one of iVolve’s key clients, lighting plant efficiency was becoming an operational and financial problem. Manually turning lighting plants on and off, the inability to locate the plant for refuelling/maintenance and operational during non-essential times is an inefficient and costly exercise. To monitor lighting plant operation, iVolve installed Mine4D Plant to monitor fuel levels, engine hour logging, door and boom state detection and reporting, engine prestart siren/beacon, remote timed for start/stop control, remote manual start/stop for maintenance checks, GPS tracking and tagging and centralised reporting. Post-installation, it was discovered that the lighting plants were being run inefficiently. Using Mine4D Plant, the site was able to make significant improvements to its operations and savings. Since installation, a change in user behaviour resulted in $200 saved/shift in labour, $110 saved/shift in running costs which lead to approx. total savings of $230,000 per year. *Assuming each plant runs an unnecessary 1hr/shift at the cost of $5/hour.
