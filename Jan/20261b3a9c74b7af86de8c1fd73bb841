Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) are an effective means of minimizing emissions of dangerous fine particles in exhaust emissions. But, in reality, DPFs are a band-aid remedy and bring with them a whole new range of expensive, annoying and inconvenient problems. However, Cost Effective Maintenance already provides a simple, low-cost solution, which addresses the root cause of these problems. What is required is to clean up the fuel burn, rather than ‘after treat’ it with a DPF. This means that less soot is produced in the first place. FTC Decarbonizer, already proven in underground mining applications, acts as a true combustion catalyst to reduce the rate of soot production, and burn off existing soot at much cooler temperatures. Once introduced into the diesel, less soot (and ash) can accumulate in the DPF, as regeneration occurs naturally during normal engine operations. DPFs particularly cause issues for non-highway type applications, and the following series of problems can progressively develop: To counter this series of problems, FTC treated diesel results in a reduction in both the total number of soot particles and the total soot mass produced. Secondly, it forces all carbon in combustion and exhaust spaces, including any soot trapped in the DPF, to combust at temperatures as low as 350⁰C to 400⁰C. Normally, soot will only combust in the 500-600⁰C, and above range. The FTC catalysed fuel burn permits the cooler soot burn. As soot is the initial binder for ash forming in DPF’s, the amount of ash accumulating is also reduced. FTC Decarbonizer is a very low-cost solution, which addresses the root cause of these DPF problems. In doing so, it minimises the need for DPF regeneration cycles, because less soot is formed, and any accumulated soot is readily combusted under even light-duty cycles.
