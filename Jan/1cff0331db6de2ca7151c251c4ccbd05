For many years, the Kestrel 1000-IS Intrinsically Safe Air Velocity Meter has been the instrument of choice for ventilation officers, and other mining personnel, to effectively monitor air flow in underground mine operations. Over time, we have often received numerous requests for a variation of the 1000-IS model that, in addition to air velocity, also measures other parameters such as relative humidity, wet / dry bulb temperature, heat stress, and more. In light of this valuable feedback, we are pleased to announce that the Kestrel 3500-IS Intrinsically Safe Pocket Weather Meter is now available. As with the 1000-IS model, 3500-IS holds Certification of Conformity for Explosion-protected electrical equipment (to Ex ia I IP55), issued by SIMTARS. About the Kestrel 3500-IS Intrinsically Safe Pocket Weather Meter The Kestrel 3500-IS Intrinsically Safe Pocket Weather Meter is a critical instrument for use in underground mine ventilation operations. Split second decisions in the field leave no time for guesswork. Get every environmental condition in seconds with the reliable Kestrel 3500-IS. A rugged, multi-function wind and weather meter that measures all the environmental variables, including air velocity (wind speed), wet / dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, heat stress index, barometric pressure, dew point and more. Every unit is fully tested for measurement accuracy and waterproof integrity and is calibrated to NIST traceable standards. Measures Intrinsic Safety The Kestrel Model 3500-IS Intrinsically Safe Pocket Weather Meter holds Certificate of Conformity for Explosion- protected Electrical Equipment (to Ex ia I IP55) issued by SIMTARS.
