We’re pleased to announce that our flagship site, CalderTech.com, is now live after having an overhaul. Apart from an improvement to the overall structure of the site, we’re also pleased to continue our commitment to providing documentation and resources on our products and the industry. In-depth manuals and helpful FAQs ensure that you are fully informed when enquiring about purchases – with users now able to add multiple items into their ‘List’ to get a quote for the entire order.\ With even more content to be added soon, feel free to bookmark the site and drop by on a regular basis.
