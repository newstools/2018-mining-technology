Duratray International has collaborated with energy group Kuhn for delivery of a fully environment-friendly lithium-ion powered truck, which is now beginning trials in Switzerland. Duratray’s European team are working with Kuhn offering a sustainable approach in both engine and dump body for the industry and after 18 months of planning, it is believed to be a gamechanger. Optimistically, following successful trials of the 60-tonne capacity truck, larger units are expected to eventuate in the future. The technology and innovation found in the Duratray SDB will provide an excellent complementary edge for the project’s ambitions to become a carbon-footprint reducing, low-noise, economically friendly industrial EV. The Duratray Suspended Dump Body system features a unique design concept that replaces the conventional steel floor, as well as any associated wear plates with a rubber mat suspended on elastomeric ropes anchored to the steel frame of the body. Numerous key features are offered including Noise Reduction, Abrasion Resistance, Increased payload and Reduced carry-back.
