For one of iVolve’s key clients, water truck efficiency was becoming an operational and financial problem. To monitor water truck operation, iVolve installed Mine4D Maintenance to determine optimal placement of a new filling point. Water trucks are a pivotal part of mining operations. Given Australia’s landscape, dust control can be a real hazard for employees, disrupting operations and causing extensive delays to production. Considering the costs associated with running and maintaining such large vehicles with specific tank specifications, custom designs and mounting apparatuses, it is essential that the trucks operate efficiently. Post-installation, it was discovered that water truck operators were leaving engines running while filling among other poor management procedures. Using Mine4D Maintenance, the site was able to make significant improvements to its operations and savings. Since installation, a change in user behavior resulted in idle times decreasing from 25% to 15%, which leads to approx. total savings of $43,500 per year.
