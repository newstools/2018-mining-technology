 Grinding of cement clinker in vertical roller mills is a technology introduced by LOESCHE, which was first used in 1935. Almost 30 years ago LOESCHE introduced the first vertical roller mill to grind both, cement clinker and granulated blast furnace slag, in one process. The concept of M-rollers and S-rollers was established in 1992, which is one of the most cost-effective and successful LOESCHE innovations. Some important attributes of a grinding system that make a perfect profitable solution are: LOESCHE is a competent partner for customers, from engineering to customer service and from meticulous project planning to handing over a plant with maximum availability. LOESCHE has the patented concept which enables the production of cement with higher Blaine and effective grinding of blast furnace slag.

The LOESCHE cement mill LM 35.2 +2 S is successfully operating Sri Balaha Chemicals Pvt. Ltd, Hindupur, produces Granulated Ground Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) of 4,000cmÂ²/gm at 50t/h. It was supplied in 2016 and installed and commissioned by March 2017. The mill achieved the rated capacity within two weeks of commissioning and achieved exceptional operational parameters with a throughput increase of the mill and a reduction in the specific power consumption. With the stability in operation and high-grinding efficiency, LOESCHE mills are broadly accepted by process industries worldwide such as the cement industry and coal-based power industry, as a preferred grinding technology, due to the various mentioned attributes coupled with state-of-the-art technology. With more than 2,200 mills worldwide (overall), LOESCHE is relentlessly working to improve and innovate grinding solutions for customer benefits.
