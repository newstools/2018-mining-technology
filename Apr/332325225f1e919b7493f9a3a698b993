The World Tunnel Congress 2018 is taking place in Dubai, UAE, from 22 to 26 April. As the world’s leading tunneling event, it brings together experts from all around the world. As a proud bronze sponsor of the event, Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology is participating. At the Sandvik stand, there will be the possibility to see an iSURE™ software demo and to find out more about Sandvik’s array of tunneling solutions. iSURE™ software (Intelligent Sandvik Underground Rock Excavation software) is a computer program for Tunneling Construction and Mining drill and blast process control. It produces all the data you need for an optimized drilling and blasting cycle. The full-featured iSURE™ software utilizes your drill rig’s data collection to improve the work cycle and the drill and blast excavation process. It also has an optional toolset for geological analysis (iSURE™ GEO), a tunnel profile 3D scanning system (iSURE™ 3D SCAN) and an interface to a third–party blasting vibration feedback system. iSURE™ software capitalises the improved accuracy of iSeries rigs for drill and blast usage. Meet us at the World Tunnel Congress from 23 to 26 April, Dubai, UAE, at the Dubai World Trade Centre, stand #115.
