Strata Worldwide announces StrataConnect DigitalBRIDGE™, a new underground network solution created through a recently established partnership with RFI Technology Solutions of Australia. Available immediately in North, South and Central America, as well as South Africa through Strata Worldwide distribution, StrataConnect DigitalBRIDGE™ is a patent-pending coaxial cable technology for high-speed digital data transfer, telemetry and voice-over-IP (VoIP) communications in underground environments. It is a Point-to-Multipoint Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) solution that is ideal for overcoming the typical constraints of underground connectivity by utilising a simple-to-install coaxial cable to carry both power and high-speed data to the edges of your mine. “Strata is very pleased to finalize this agreement with RFI Technology Solutions, as it supports Strata’s growth in underground communications with the continued approach of bringing novel products to market,” states Mike Berube, chief executive officer of Strata Worldwide. “The outstanding advantage of the DigitalBRIDGE™ system is the power and data being transported in a single cable, which provides a high level of flexibility in the system engineering. Operations can configure and reconfigure the network on the fly, and place Ethernet end-point devices anywhere they are required.” DigitalBRIDGE™ coax cable provides complete network flexibility with the ability to add end-point devices at any point along the cable; Wi-Fi access points, gas sensors, atmospheric monitors, RFID readers, cameras and more. DigitalBRIDGE™ cable segments can extend up to 6,500ft (2,000m) without the need for a repeater or dedicated power source. It can be a standalone system, or can be used as an extension of existing fibre networks to reach further into and in multiple directions of the mine.
