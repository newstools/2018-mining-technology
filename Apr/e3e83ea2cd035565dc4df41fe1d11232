 MOSS (Miner Operated Survey System) can now perform Face and Back Mapping directly on the MOSS tablet, allowing field geologists to digitize their work in a fraction of the time. Studies indicate that each site’s Field Geologist can save a minimum of eight hours of digitizing per week using MOSS’s face mapping tools. MOSS has three available options to perform Geo Mapping.
