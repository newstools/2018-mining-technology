 Crashed vehicles are disastrous for a mine site, putting the entire production process out of kilter and causing mass confusion. One single incident can result in a complete standstill of operations, causing thousands of dollars in lost production. Identifying the location of vehicles before an accident is essential for quick and accurate investigation. Problem Without real-time feedback capabilities, it is impossible to establish the vehicles that were operating in the area before an incident occurred. Vehicle location play-back capabilities allows management to assess if operator handling had any impact on the crash, or whether other factors such as road quality, machine faults etc. were responsible. Solution Vehicle location play-back capabilities allows management to assess if operator handling had any impact on the crash, or whether other factors such as road quality, machine faults etc. were responsible. In addition, identifying that the vehicle was not in the vicinity of an accident allows for a strong defence against claims of operator injury during shift and claims of machine abuse for warranty requests. iControl is the iVolve map-based visualisation tool displaying your fleetsâ€™ real-time data for a complete overview of the state of the fleet and assets. iControl gives management the ability to confirm what vehicles were operating at the location of the incident and if they had any impact on the incident itself.
