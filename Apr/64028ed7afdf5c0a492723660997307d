senseFly’s eBee Plus, eBee SQ and albris drones have been added to Transport Canada’s list of ‘Compliant Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)’, a distinction that allows Canadian organisations using senseFly drones to apply for Compliant Operator status. The new designation, held by only a few drone producers, mirrors that of senseFly’s original eBee drone, which became Canada’s first compliant fixed -wing drone in 2015. In Canada, companies that employ drones for civilian applications must have a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC), unless qualifying for an exemption. If an organisation has a SFOC and is granted Compliant Operator status, it gains the additional benefit of: Currently, senseFly is the only company offering compliant fixed-wing drones. “Canadian operators using senseFly products can now work towards their full compliant operation status,” explained Felix Weber, CEO at Ag Business & Crop/UKKO , a senseFly Canadian distribution partner. “Compliance means applications are streamlined and can be used nationwide. Our business supports this effort through our FlySmart UAV Compliant Ground School Training program with a commercial flight instructor.” Transport Canada, the governmental department responsible for transportation policies and programs, promotes safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible transportation. “senseFly’s full line of solutions now officially meet Transport Canada’s standards of safety and efficiency, meaning we will be able to help even more Canadian operators boost their business,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, CEO at senseFly. “We’re proud of this achievement and enthusiastic about what’s ahead.” “This is another defining development from senseFly and its complete commitment to forwarding the development of safe, responsible and accountable UAV platforms and operations for professionals in Canada,” added Peter Willis, UAV Technical Sales Representative at Spatial Technologies, a senseFly Canadian distribution partner. “A truly legitimate benefit and advantage for existing professional operators and future users alike.”
