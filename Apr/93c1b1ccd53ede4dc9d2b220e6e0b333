EURO-PS wavy top polyurethane screen panels are an invention and unique product of EUROGOMMA. The top surface is characterized by symmetrical ramps along the flow where screening apertures are located. This innovative design creates two fantastic effects increasing classification efficiency: Thanks to the top ramps the screening surface, if flattened, would give a width of 404mm against the standard value of 305mm, giving a 32.5% increase. Last but not least the ramps create a tremendously high mechanical structure of the product resisting heavy load and impacting slurry much better than standard panels. This is especially important at the feed end of the screen deck where kinetic force of the slurry is typically very strong.
