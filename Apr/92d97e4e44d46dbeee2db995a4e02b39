Miner Elastomer Products Corporation (MEPC) is excited to be exhibiting at EXPOMIN in Santiago, Chile from 23 to 27 April. During this show, we will be showcasing our energy absorbing TecsPak® products in the Illinois Pavilion in Hall two at booth G50. Be sure to stop by our booth to find out more about our mining suspensions. Our TecsPak® Dual Ride Suspensions can be used on CAT, Hitachi and Komatsu mining trucks. These one-of-a-kind suspensions are virtually maintenance-free and will help reduce maintenance time and costs at your mining facility. These suspensions have been extremely successful on water trucks for numerous mines and can also be used on haul trucks with load monitoring capabilities. MEPC manufactures shovel components for the mining industry as well. Our shovel components are OEM-certified components and improve performance, reduce downtime and increase shovel output. Our shovel components are designed to absorb maximum load capacities while reducing wear and tear on hinges and weldments within the bucket. We will also be showcasing our virtually indestructible wheel chocks for the mining industry during EXPOMIN as well. These wheel chocks can survive an accidental run over and will not cause any damage to your trucks tires. They are ergonomically designed with five different sizes to suit your facility’s needs. Miner Elastomer is also unveiling our new Spanish website during this show. The new Spanish section of the website allows users to switch between English content and Spanish content seamlessly. All the user has to do is click the Spanish flag and the translation will automatically appear! For more information, please contact Miner Elastomer.
