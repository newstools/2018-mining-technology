Ausroad Systems has just completed manufacture of its 20th Stemming Hire Truck (APS 20) at its Archerfield-based manufacturing facilities based in Brisbane.  Our team of skilled workshop staff have completed two Stemming Hire Trucks simultaneously for hire contracts with BHP Billiton BMA, (BM Alliance Coal Operations Pty Ltd) Cavil Ridge Mine, Queensland and Rio Tinto, Paraburdoo Mine in Western Australia. Both Stemming Trucks are fitted to Volvo FMx118R Mine Spec cab chassis’ supplied by Volvo Commercial Vehicles, Richlands, Queensland.  The Volvo cab chassis’ have proven to be well suited to mine site conditions and are comfortable to drive and operate in this harsh environment. BMA are currently hiring a number of AUSROAD Stemming Trucks and AUSROAD Water Trucks for various Queensland Mine Sites, including Peak Downs, Goonyella, Daunia, Saraji, Peakdowns and Cavil Ridge.  Skilled operators are provided by Ausroad that can move between projects / sites and cover changes in workflow. Ausroad maintains and services the trucks at its Moranbah based workshop, operators are only required to look after greasing systems and complete pre-start inspections.  A spare truck is available for when a Stemming Truck requires servicing and maintenance, downtime and disruption to the Mine Site Stemming Programme is kept to a minimum.
