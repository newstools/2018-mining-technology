Weâ€™re pleased to announce that Midwest Valves & Controls will have a fully refreshed website soon. We will have the product categories changed to cover industrial valves, pumps, diesel handling and lubrication equipment, and instrumentation (process instruments sensing pressure, temperature, level and flow). In the meantime, we invite your enquiries. With even more content to be added soon, feel free to bookmark the site and drop by on a regular basis.
